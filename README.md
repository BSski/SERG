- animals can eat herbs now
- added movement energy cost
- added breeding

21.04
- adding new objects by key
- added coding of the traits using "DNA"
- increased grid size from 13x13 to 43x43

20.04
- created animal class
- calling objects from objects list
- animals can move now

19.04
- setting intervals for particular objects
- added function creating a square moving randomly around the grid
- the square bounces off the edges now
- three squares moving randomly around the grid with different speeds, bouncing off the edges
